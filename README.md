## EbookVocabularyConverter (EVC)
### Introduction

EbookVocabularyConverter is a private desktop application designed to enhance language learning through interactive vocabulary extracted from ebooks. It allows users to mark, translate, and transfer vocabulary to Anki for efficient study, all within a user-friendly GUI.
### Features

  * Interactive Vocabulary Display
  * Marking and Extraction
  * Translation Integration
  * Anki Integration

### Requirements

  * JDK Temurin 17
  * Anki with Ankiconnect installed and activated
  * Internet connection for translation and Anki synchronization
  * Google Cloud Translate API key (not provided in the repo)

### Usage
#### Launching the Application

The EVC is intended for private use only. The API key for GCP is not included; if you own or have acquired one for your personal use, feel free to clone and use the EVC. However, please note that it is not possible to build a JAR due to conflicts with Google Libraries, even though the Google Libraries BOM is used to resolve transitive dependencies.

### Making Selections

Use the choice box to make selections for title, type, endmark, and vocabulary. This feature allows you to filter and specify the text you want to focus on. The title is a concatenated string, allowing for the selection of more than one word.
